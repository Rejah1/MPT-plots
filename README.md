# MPT-plots
MATLAB

MPTxxx uses completly uncorelated assets (identity covariance matrix)

CorrMPTxxx uses correlated assets

running CorrMPT and MPT gives plot of size of weights returned by the optimizer, uses 50 assets and 1265 days of data. 



running CorrMPTCall and MPTCall returns the true risk of portfolios produced by the optimizer for different lengths of time series (for different vlaues of N/T).
